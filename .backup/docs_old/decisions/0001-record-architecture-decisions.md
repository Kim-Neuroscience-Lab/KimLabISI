# 1. Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2025-10-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We are undertaking a major refactoring of a complex codebase that has grown organically without clear architectural guidelines. We need to:

- Document why we're making specific technical choices
- Ensure the team understands the reasoning behind constraints
- Avoid rehashing the same discussions
- Provide context for future team members

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document all significant architectural decisions. Each ADR will be:

- Numbered sequentially
- Written in Markdown
- Stored in `docs/decisions/`
- Linked from relevant code and documentation
- Reviewed in pull requests when created or modified

## Consequences

### Positive

- Creates a decision log for the project
- Helps onboard new team members
- Prevents revisiting settled decisions without cause
- Provides traceability for technical choices

### Negative

- Requires discipline to maintain
- Adds a small overhead to decision-making process

### Risks

- May become stale if not maintained
- Team might skip documentation under pressure

## Related Decisions

- This is the first ADR and establishes the pattern for all others
