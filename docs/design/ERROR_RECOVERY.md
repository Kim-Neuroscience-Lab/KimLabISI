**Frame Rate Tolerance:**
- **Stimulus Display**: Accept 59.8-60.2 FPS with clear logging
- **Camera Capture**: Accept 29-31 FPS with quality assessment
- **Warning**: "Frame rate deviation detected - verify scientific validity"
- **Data Marking**: Flag affected frames in analysis correlation

**Memory Pressure Management:**
- **Trigger**: >85% memory usage in any component allocation
- **Action**: Reduce buffer sizes while maintaining functionality
- **Warning**: "Memory constraints - buffer sizes reduced"
- **Monitoring**: Track impact on frame drop rates

### Hardware Fault Tolerance

**GPU Performance Degradation:**
- **Thermal Throttling**: Continue with performance monitoring
- **VRAM Pressure**: Stream from Samsung 990 PRO more aggressively
- **Driver Issues**: Attempt context recreation with user notification
