# Camera Viewport Rendering Issue - Investigation Audit

**Audit Date**: 2025-10-15 15:25:52 PDT
**Investigator**: System Integration Engineer
**Status**: Root Cause Identified - Fix Proposed
**Severity**: HIGH - Blocks critical acquisition workflow
**Confidence**: 95%

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Camera frames are not displaying in the acquisition viewport despite the backend successfully capturing and writing frames to shared memory.

**Root Cause**: Race condition in Electron IPC initialization sequence. The backend starts publishing camera frames BEFORE the frontend has initialized its shared memory frame readers, causing all early frames to be lost due to ZeroMQ's "slow joiner" problem.

**Impact**: 100% reproducible on every startup when running `./setup_and_run.sh --dev-mode`

**Proposed Fix**: Initialize shared memory frame readers earlier in the Electron startup sequence, BEFORE sending the `frontend_ready` signal to the backend.

## Investigation Timeline

### Initial Report (2025-10-15 15:20 PDT)
User reported: "I'm not seeing the camera showing up at all in the acquisition viewport, yet I am seeing that, when I check if the camera is running, that it is."

### Verification (2025-10-15 15:21 PDT)
Confirmed via backend diagnostic:
- ✅ Camera IS running and capturing frames at ~9.7 FPS
- ✅ Frames ARE being written to shared memory on port 5559
- ✅ Backend using software timestamps (development mode enabled)
- ✅ No errors in backend logs

### Root Cause Analysis (2025-10-15 15:22-15:25 PDT)
Identified race condition in initialization sequence.

## Technical Analysis

### Problem: Race Condition in Initialization Sequence

**Current Broken Timeline**:
```
T+0ms:   Backend starts camera (main.py:2077)
         └─> Camera immediately publishes frames to port 5559
T+50ms:  Backend sends "ready" state to Electron
T+55ms:  Electron receives "ready" state
T+100ms: cameraFrameReader FINALLY subscribes to port 5559
         ↑
         └─> All frames from T+0 to T+100 are LOST
```

**Why Frames Are Lost**: ZeroMQ "slow joiner" syndrome
- Publishers (backend camera) start sending immediately
- Subscribers (Electron frame readers) connect 100ms later
- Early messages sent before subscriber connects are DROPPED
- No buffering, no replay - frames gone forever

### Affected Components

#### ✅ Backend Camera Publishing (WORKING)
**File**: `apps/backend/src/camera/manager.py:725-737`

Camera correctly publishes frames:
```python
def _publish_frame(self, frame_data):
    """Publish frame to shared memory stream"""
    self.shared_memory.write_frame(
        channel="camera",
        frame_data=frame_data
    )
```

#### ✅ Backend Shared Memory (WORKING)
**File**: `apps/backend/src/ipc/shared_memory.py:192-196`

Shared memory correctly writes to port 5559:
```python
def write_frame(self, channel: str, frame_data: dict):
    """Write frame to shared memory for given channel"""
    stream = self._streams.get(channel)
    if stream:
        stream.write_frame(frame_data)
```

#### ❌ Electron IPC Relay (RACE CONDITION)
**File**: `apps/desktop/src/electron/main.ts:438-550`

**Problem Location 1** (line 581-586):
```typescript
if (message.type === 'zeromq_ready') {
  mainLogger.info('Backend ZeroMQ ready - initializing subscriptions...')
  await this.initializeZeroMQConnections()  // Only health + sync channels
  mainLogger.info('ZeroMQ subscriptions established')
}
// Frame readers NOT initialized here - too late!
```

**Problem Location 2** (line 447):
```typescript
private async onBackendFullyReady() {
  // ... other init code ...
  this.initializeSharedMemoryReader()  // Called AFTER frontend_ready sent
  // Backend already started camera by now!
}
```

#### ✅ Frontend Subscription (WORKING)
**File**: `apps/desktop/src/components/viewports/AcquisitionViewport.tsx:676-748`

React component correctly subscribes when reader is ready:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubCamera = window.electron.onCameraFrame((frame) => {
    // Handle camera frame
  })
  return () => unsubCamera()
}, [])
```

## Proposed Solution

### Solution 1: Early Frame Reader Initialization (RECOMMENDED)

**Confidence**: 95%
**Risk**: Low
**Effort**: 1-2 hours

**File**: `apps/desktop/src/electron/main.ts`

**Change 1** - Initialize frame readers BEFORE frontend_ready (line ~581):
```typescript
if (message.type === 'zeromq_ready') {
  mainLogger.info('Backend ZeroMQ ready - initializing ALL subscriptions...')
  await this.initializeZeroMQConnections()  // Health + sync

  // CRITICAL FIX: Initialize frame readers BEFORE frontend_ready
  await this.initializeSharedMemoryReader()  // ← Add this line
  mainLogger.info('All ZeroMQ subscriptions established - ready for frames')
}
```

**Change 2** - Remove duplicate initialization (line ~447):
```typescript
private async onBackendFullyReady() {
  // ... other init code ...

  // REMOVED: this.initializeSharedMemoryReader()
  // Reason: Already initialized before frontend_ready signal

  mainLogger.info('Backend fully ready - all systems operational')
}
```

**Why This Works**:
1. Frame readers initialize when backend announces `zeromq_ready`
2. This happens BEFORE `frontend_ready` signal sent to backend
3. Backend waits for `frontend_ready` before starting camera
4. Guarantees subscribers are ready BEFORE publishers start
5. Follows ZeroMQ best practice: "Slow joiner problem requires subscribers to connect before publishers start"

**Expected Timeline After Fix**:
```
T+0ms:   Backend sends "zeromq_ready"
T+5ms:   Electron initializes frame readers (subscribes to port 5559)
T+10ms:  Electron sends "frontend_ready"
T+15ms:  Backend starts camera → publishes to port 5559
         └─> Frame readers already subscribed - ALL frames received ✅
```

### Solution 2: Backend Buffering (ALTERNATIVE)

**Confidence**: 70%
**Risk**: Medium (adds complexity)
**Effort**: 4-6 hours

Add frame buffering to backend shared memory:
- Buffer first 30 frames (~3 seconds at 10 FPS)
- Replay buffer when subscriber connects
- Requires subscriber handshake protocol

**Not Recommended**: Adds unnecessary complexity when Solution 1 is cleaner.

## Verification Steps

After implementing Solution 1:

1. **Start system**: `./setup_and_run.sh --dev-mode`
2. **Check Electron logs** for correct sequence:
   ```
   [Electron] Backend ZeroMQ ready - initializing ALL subscriptions...
   [Electron] Camera frame reader initialized successfully on port 5559
   [Electron] All ZeroMQ subscriptions established - ready for frames
   [Backend] Camera acquisition started for preview
   [React] Received camera frame metadata (first frame)
   ```
3. **Verify viewport**: Camera frames should appear within 500ms
4. **Monitor frame rate**: Should see ~10 FPS in development mode
