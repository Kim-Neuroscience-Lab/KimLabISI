# 11. Error Recovery and Graceful Degradation

Date: 2025-01-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Scientific data acquisition systems face multiple failure scenarios that must not result in data loss or undefined system states:

- **Hardware Failures**: Camera disconnection, GPU errors, storage device failures
- **Software Failures**: Memory exhaustion, processing timeouts, communication breakdowns
- **Environmental Factors**: Power fluctuations, thermal issues, hardware disconnections
- **User Errors**: Invalid parameter combinations, premature operation termination
- **System Resource Constraints**: Insufficient memory, disk space, or processing capacity

Traditional error handling approaches would either:
1. Crash the application, losing valuable scientific data and session state
2. Continue with undefined behavior, compromising data integrity
3. Provide generic error messages without actionable recovery guidance
4. Require complete session restart, losing significant progress

Scientific applications require sophisticated error handling because:
- Data acquisition sessions may represent hours of experimental work
- Hardware setup and calibration are time-consuming and expensive
- Reproducibility requires exact session state preservation
- Real-time requirements demand immediate error response

## Decision

We will implement **comprehensive error recovery with graceful degradation** strategies:

### Error Classification System
- **Recoverable Errors**: Temporary failures that can be resolved automatically or with user intervention
- **Degradation Errors**: Partial system failures where reduced functionality can continue
- **Critical Errors**: Failures requiring immediate session termination with data preservation

### Error Recovery Mechanisms

#### Automatic Recovery
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures (network, hardware communication)
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic memory and resource deallocation on failures
- **State Rollback**: Restore to last known good state for configuration errors
- **Alternative Pathways**: Switch to backup hardware or software implementations

#### User-Guided Recovery
- **Error Context**: Detailed error information with system state at failure
- **Recovery Options**: Clear choices for continuing, retrying, or aborting operations
- **Progress Preservation**: Save partial progress before attempting recovery
- **Expert Mode**: Advanced recovery options for experienced users

#### Graceful Degradation Modes
- **Reduced Performance**: Continue with lower quality settings or frame rates
- **Mock Hardware Fallback**: Switch to software simulation when hardware fails
- **Essential Features Only**: Disable non-critical functionality to preserve core operations
- **Read-Only Mode**: Allow data viewing and export when acquisition hardware fails

### Implementation Strategy

#### Error State Integration
- **Hardware Disconnection**: Camera communication failures and device unavailability
- **Memory Exhaustion**: Insufficient system or GPU memory for operations
- **Storage Full**: Disk space limitations preventing data storage
- **Communication Timeout**: Frontend-backend IPC/WebSocket failures
- **Invalid Configuration**: Parameter validation and compatibility errors

#### Recovery Action Categories
- **Automatic Retry**: Transient failures with exponential backoff strategies
- **User Intervention**: Guided recovery requiring user decisions
- **Graceful Degradation**: Reduced functionality with mock hardware fallback
- **Critical Shutdown**: Safe termination with complete data preservation

#### External Package Integration
- **Error Handling Libraries**: Leverage proven retry libraries and circuit breaker patterns from established packages
- **State Management**: Use validated state persistence libraries rather than custom serialization
- **Local Storage**: Utilize operating system file system APIs for local data protection
- **Monitoring Tools**: Utilize established system monitoring and health check frameworks

#### Data Protection Strategy
- **Atomic Operations**: HDF5 built-in atomic write operations for data integrity
- **Validated Libraries**: Use proven checkpoint and recovery libraries from scientific computing ecosystem
- **File System APIs**: Leverage operating system file system APIs for local redundant storage
- **Transaction Safety**: Utilize database-style transaction libraries for critical state changes

### Error Recovery Workflows

#### Hardware Failure Recovery
1. **Detect**: Hardware communication timeout or error response
2. **Isolate**: Stop dependent operations and preserve current data
3. **Diagnose**: Attempt hardware reconnection and capability testing
4. **Recover**: Restart hardware subsystem or switch to mock implementation
5. **Resume**: Continue operation with original or degraded capability

#### Memory/Resource Exhaustion
1. **Monitor**: Continuous resource utilization tracking
2. **Predict**: Early warning before critical resource depletion
3. **Optimize**: Automatic memory cleanup and buffer management
4. **Degrade**: Reduce quality settings or disable non-essential features
5. **Alert**: User notification with options for manual intervention

#### Communication Breakdown
1. **Timeout**: Detect frontend-backend IPC/WebSocket communication failures
2. **Reconnect**: Automatic IPC/WebSocket reconnection attempts using established libraries
3. **Buffer**: Maintain operation state during temporary process communication failures
4. **Synchronize**: Re-synchronize state when IPC/WebSocket communication restored
5. **Failsafe**: Preserve data locally and enter safe mode if reconnection fails

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Data Protection**: Scientific data never lost due to system failures
- **Session Continuity**: Users can continue work after recovering from errors
- **System Reliability**: Predictable behavior during failure scenarios
- **User Confidence**: Clear error communication and recovery guidance
- **Debugging Support**: Comprehensive error context for troubleshooting
- **Graceful Degradation**: Partial functionality better than complete failure

### Negative

- **Implementation Complexity**: Sophisticated error handling increases code complexity
- **Testing Overhead**: Must test numerous failure scenarios and recovery paths
- **Performance Impact**: Error detection and recovery mechanisms may impact performance
- **User Interface Complexity**: Error recovery UI adds complexity to user experience
- **State Management Overhead**: Checkpoint and rollback systems require additional resources

### Risks

- **Recovery Loops**: Automatic recovery could get stuck in failure cycles
- **Incomplete Recovery**: Partial recovery may leave system in inconsistent state
- **Error Masking**: Graceful degradation might hide serious underlying problems
- **Resource Leaks**: Error recovery paths may not properly clean up resources
- **User Confusion**: Complex recovery options may overwhelm non-expert users

## Alternatives Considered

- **Simple Error Logging**: Rejected as insufficient for scientific data protection
- **Application Restart**: Rejected due to session state loss and user productivity impact
- **External Monitoring**: Rejected as reactive rather than proactive error handling
- **Error Propagation Only**: Rejected as placing too much burden on users
- **Hardware-Specific Recovery**: Rejected due to lack of abstraction and maintainability

## Related Decisions

- Depends on: ADR-0006 (Twelve-State Workflow State Machine - ERROR, RECOVERY, DEGRADED states)
- Depends on: ADR-0010 (Hardware Abstraction Layer - mock hardware fallback)
- Depends on: ADR-0009 (HDF5 Scientific Data Storage - atomic operations, data integrity)
- Enables: Future ADRs on monitoring systems, backup strategies, disaster recovery

## Notes

Error recovery strategy balances user productivity with data integrity requirements specific to scientific applications. The approach recognizes that:

- Scientific experiments are expensive and time-consuming to restart
- Data integrity is more important than system performance
- Users need clear guidance during failure scenarios
- System should degrade gracefully rather than fail catastrophically

Implementation priorities:
1. **Data Protection First**: Never lose acquired scientific data
2. **Clear Communication**: Users always understand system state and options
3. **Automatic When Safe**: Automate recovery for well-understood failure modes
4. **User Control**: Provide expert users with manual override capabilities
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed error logs for post-incident analysis

The strategy enables reliable scientific data acquisition even in the presence of hardware failures, environmental issues, and software errors.
