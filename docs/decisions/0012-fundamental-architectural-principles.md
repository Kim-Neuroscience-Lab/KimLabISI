# 12. Fundamental Architectural Principles

Date: 2025-01-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The ISI Macroscope Control System requires a robust architectural foundation to ensure long-term maintainability, testability, and scientific reliability. The system involves complex interactions between:

- Real-time scientific data acquisition with microsecond precision requirements
- Cross-platform development (macOS development, Windows production)
- Hardware abstraction across different platforms and mock implementations
- Multi-layered architecture (frontend UI, backend processing, hardware control)
- Scientific data integrity and reproducibility requirements

Without clear architectural principles, the system would suffer from:
- Tight coupling between components making testing difficult
- Code duplication across similar functionalities
- Mixed responsibilities within components
- Multiple sources of truth for configuration and state
- Over-engineering of features not required for scientific applications

## Decision

We will adhere to **fundamental architectural principles** as the foundation for all design and implementation decisions:

### SOLID Principles

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each class and module has one reason to change
- Hardware control, data processing, and UI concerns are separated
- Scientific algorithms isolated from infrastructure concerns
- State management separated from business logic

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Components open for extension, closed for modification
- Hardware abstraction layer allows new hardware without core changes
- Plugin architecture for analysis algorithms
- Configuration-driven behavior rather than code modifications

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Mock hardware implementations fully substitute production hardware
- Cross-platform implementations provide identical interfaces
- Error handling consistent across all component substitutions

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Specialized interfaces for specific hardware capabilities
- Separate interfaces for different workflow phases
- No component forced to depend on unused functionality

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules independent of low-level implementation details
- Hardware abstractions depend on interfaces, not concrete implementations
- Business logic independent of framework-specific concerns

### Design Principles

#### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- Single source of truth for all configuration and parameters
- Shared validation logic across frontend and backend
- Common error handling patterns throughout system
- Reusable components across different workflow phases

#### Separation of Concerns (SoC)
- Clear boundaries between domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- Scientific data processing isolated from UI and communication concerns
- Hardware control separated from data analysis
- Cross-cutting concerns (logging, monitoring) handled independently

#### Single Source of Truth (SSoT)
- Configuration parameters defined once and shared across components
- State management centralized within each architectural layer
- Scientific metadata stored with data, not separately
- Version information managed in single location

#### You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)
- Features implemented only when required for scientific workflows
- No speculative abstractions for potential future requirements
- Simple solutions preferred over complex generalizations
- External validated packages used instead of custom implementations

### Scientific Computing Principles

#### Data Integrity First
- Scientific data never modified without explicit user intent
- Atomic operations for all critical data modifications
- Comprehensive validation of all scientific parameters
- Immutable data structures where possible

#### Reproducibility Requirements
- Complete parameter provenance for all scientific operations
- Deterministic behavior across different execution environments
- Version tracking for all algorithms and data transformations
- Exact parameter matching for dataset reuse

#### Performance with Reliability
- Real-time requirements met without compromising data integrity
- Graceful degradation preferred over system failures
- Hardware-specific optimizations within abstraction boundaries
- Memory management appropriate for large scientific datasets

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Maintainability**: Clear principles guide all design decisions and code reviews
- **Testability**: Separation of concerns enables comprehensive unit and integration testing
- **Scientific Reliability**: Data integrity and reproducibility principles ensure scientific validity
- **Developer Productivity**: Consistent patterns reduce cognitive load and decision fatigue
- **Long-term Sustainability**: Principles prevent architectural decay over time
- **Quality Assurance**: Objective criteria for evaluating architectural decisions

### Negative

- **Initial Overhead**: Principle adherence requires more initial design and implementation time
- **Learning Curve**: Team members must understand and consistently apply principles
- **Decision Complexity**: Must evaluate all changes against multiple principle requirements
- **Potential Over-Engineering**: Strict principle adherence may add unnecessary complexity for simple features

### Risks

- **Principle Conflicts**: Different principles may suggest contradictory approaches
- **Implementation Inconsistency**: Team members may interpret principles differently
- **Maintenance Drift**: Pressure to deliver quickly may compromise principle adherence
- **Performance Trade-offs**: Principle adherence may conflict with performance optimization

## Alternatives Considered

- **Ad-hoc Architecture**: Rejected due to long-term maintainability concerns for scientific applications
- **Framework-Specific Patterns**: Rejected due to cross-platform requirements and technology evolution
- **Domain-Driven Design Only**: Rejected as insufficient for hardware integration and real-time requirements
- **Microservices Architecture**: Rejected as inappropriate for desktop scientific applications
- **Pure Functional Programming**: Rejected due to hardware control and real-time processing requirements

## Notes

These principles serve as the architectural foundation for all system design decisions. They are particularly important for scientific applications where:

- Data integrity cannot be compromised
- Reproducibility is essential for scientific validity
- Long-term maintainability ensures continued research capability
- Cross-platform compatibility enables broader scientific collaboration

Implementation guidelines:
- All architectural decisions evaluated against these principles
- Code reviews must verify principle adherence
- Documentation must explain how principles are applied
- Training ensures team understanding and consistent application
- Regular architectural reviews validate ongoing principle compliance

The principles balance scientific computing requirements with modern software engineering best practices, ensuring both scientific validity and long-term system sustainability.
