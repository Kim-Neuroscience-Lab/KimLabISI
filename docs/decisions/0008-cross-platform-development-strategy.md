# 8. Cross-Platform Development Strategy

Date: 2025-01-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The ISI Macroscope Control System has conflicting platform requirements:

- **Development Environment**: Developers prefer macOS for superior development tools and workflow
- **Production Environment**: Scientific hardware (PCO Panda 4.2, RTX 4070, DirectX 12) requires Windows
- **Algorithm Development**: Scientific algorithms should be platform-agnostic for broader collaboration
- **Hardware Integration**: Platform-specific APIs required for optimal performance (DirectX 12, CUDA, PCO SDK)

Traditional approaches would either:
1. Force all development onto Windows, reducing developer productivity
2. Compromise on production performance by avoiding platform-specific optimizations
3. Maintain separate codebases, increasing maintenance burden

## Decision

We will implement a **cross-platform development strategy** with platform-specific optimizations:

### Development Platform: macOS
- **Primary Development**: macOS for algorithm development, UI design, and testing
- **Mock Hardware**: Complete hardware simulation for development without production equipment
- **Metal Backend**: GPU acceleration using Metal for development workflows
- **Algorithm Validation**: Scientific algorithms validated on macOS before Windows optimization

### Production Platform: Windows
- **Hardware Integration**: Native DirectX 12, CUDA, and PCO SDK integration
- **Performance Optimization**: Platform-specific optimizations for real-time requirements
- **Production Deployment**: Final system deployed exclusively on Windows

### Cross-Platform Components
- **Core Algorithms**: Platform-agnostic scientific computing (NumPy, SciPy, CuPy)
- **Frontend Application**: Electron ensures consistent UI across platforms
- **Data Formats**: HDF5 and JSON ensure data compatibility
- **Testing**: Automated tests run on both platforms via GitHub Actions

### Platform Abstraction
- **Hardware Interface Layer**: Abstract hardware operations behind common interfaces
- **Platform-Specific Implementations**: Windows (DirectX, PCO SDK) and macOS (Mock, Metal)
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific settings and capabilities

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Developer Productivity**: macOS development environment improves developer experience
- **Hardware Performance**: Windows-specific optimizations maintain real-time requirements
- **Algorithm Portability**: Cross-platform core enables broader scientific collaboration
- **Development Flexibility**: Can develop without expensive production hardware
- **Risk Mitigation**: Platform independence reduces vendor lock-in
- **Testing Coverage**: Multi-platform testing catches compatibility issues early

### Negative

- **Complexity Overhead**: Platform abstraction layer adds architectural complexity
- **Testing Burden**: Must validate functionality on both platforms
- **Development Setup**: Developers need access to both macOS and Windows environments
- **Performance Gaps**: Mock hardware can't fully replicate production timing characteristics
- **Maintenance Cost**: Platform-specific code paths require separate maintenance

### Risks

- **Performance Divergence**: macOS development may not catch Windows-specific performance issues
- **Hardware Simulation Gaps**: Mock hardware may not expose real hardware failure modes
- **Platform Drift**: Different behavior between platforms could emerge over time
- **Integration Complexity**: Platform-specific libraries may have incompatible interfaces

## Alternatives Considered

- **Windows-Only Development**: Rejected due to developer productivity and collaboration concerns
- **macOS-Only Deployment**: Rejected due to hardware availability and DirectX requirements
- **Linux Development/Deployment**: Rejected due to DirectX and PCO SDK limitations
- **Full Platform Agnostic**: Rejected due to performance requirements for real-time scientific applications
- **Container-Based Development**: Rejected due to hardware integration requirements

## Related Decisions

- Depends on: ADR-0004 (Modern Technology Stack)
- Enables: Future ADRs on hardware abstraction, testing strategy, deployment automation

## Notes

This strategy enables the best of both worlds:
- Superior development experience on macOS
- Optimal production performance on Windows
- Scientific algorithm portability

Implementation requires:
- Clear hardware abstraction interfaces
- Comprehensive mock hardware implementations
- Platform-specific optimization paths
- Automated cross-platform testing
- Clear documentation of platform differences

The approach is validated by similar strategies in professional scientific software where development and production platforms often differ for practical reasons.
