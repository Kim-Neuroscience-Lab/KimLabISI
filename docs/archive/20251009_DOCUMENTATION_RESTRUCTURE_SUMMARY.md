## Migration Guide

### For Developers

**Old workflow** (scattered files in root):
```
❌ Check AUDIT_REPORT.md, ARCHITECTURE_CLEANUP_AUDIT.md,
   TIMING_DATA_FLOW_AUDIT.md, etc. to understand system
```

**New workflow** (organized structure):
```
✅ Start with docs/README.md → follow links to relevant sections
   - New to project? → docs/guides/getting-started.md
   - Understand architecture? → docs/architecture/overview.md
   - Working on acquisition? → docs/components/acquisition-system.md
   - Why was X designed this way? → docs/technical-decisions/
```

### For Historical Research

All original audit files preserved in `docs/archive/` with timestamps:
```
docs/archive/20251009_ORIGINAL_FILENAME.md
```

Each includes header linking to new documentation.
